## What is Pantry Packer?
A single database and network for food pantries to indicate which food items they currently require or possess in excess, allowing users to tailor donations to specific locations.

## Social Issue Addressed:
I am looking to address the social issue of hunger.

## The Idea:
Typically, food pantries welcome food from anyone willing to donate. There are some cases, however, where specific food pantries may already have more than enough of a certain item or could really do with more of another type of item. For example, it is great that so any people donate canned goods, but suppose a food pantry is really looking for more fresh produce. Updating their personal websites every time a new food item is needed can be tedious, and prevents the public from being able to view the needs of many pantries at once.

Instead of having to deal with this hassle, pantries can contribute to Pantry Packer’s database, specifying the items that they would prefer to receive as donations as well as the items that they don’t need any more of. The general public could then look at the requests of many pantries at the same time in order to determine which location would suit their donations best.

For food pantries, my application would enable these organizations to specify exactly what kind of donations they are looking for. For the general public, my application would enable donors to tailor their donations to the right pantries, based on what they have to offer and what certain locations are looking for.
