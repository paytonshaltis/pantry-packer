## Pantry Packer Development History
Pantry Packer is an application designed and developed by Payton Shaltis in Dr. Pulimood's Spring 2022 semester of CSC-415: Software Engineering. This project was designed to be expanded upon in future semesters by other students of the class in an open source manner. Below are a number of guidelines that one should follow when attempting to modify, update, or add functionality to the application:

## Issue and Bug Discussions
Because the project is already hosted on GitHub, the 'issues' feature offered on this platform is likely the best choice for indicating issues and bugs with the application. A 'project' kanban board is already set up, with three distinct categories of issues. This should be maintained and utilized to organize issues and bugs to be fixed.

## Future Plan Discussions
The kanban board above is not restricted to only issues and bugs. New features can be suggested using the same 'issues' feature available on the GitHub platform, and will keep them organized in the same 'project'. Keeping features and bugs together will help future developers determine exactly what is more of a priority at each point in time; some bugs are comparable to features in terms of importance and haste with which they should be fixed / implemented.

## New Functionality Implementation Process
Functionality should be implemented in order of relative importance with other proposed functionality or bugs. By using the kanban board to organize functionality, it will be much easier for future developers to determine which functions are more important than others, and identify which should be prioritized. Additionally, functions that are already in progress are likely ones of higher importance and should be prioritized over those that have not been started yet. Again, consulting the 'issues' on GitHub for this repository is the best place to stay organized with bug and functionality priority.

## Which Code Makes the Cut
Not all code can be integrated into the existing application, so choosing code carefully is required in order to preserve the most important functionality of the project. Only code that (a) signigicantly improves a feature that already exists, (b) adds a new feature that did not already exist, or (c) fixes a bug within the application, should be permitted into the `main` branch of the repository. Pull requests should require at least multiple reviews by others in order to ensure that new code is satisfying at least one of the above requirements.
